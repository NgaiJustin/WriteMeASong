[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all of my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
I know we can't be together ever again
You told me this forever, I ain't know forever could end
You had me fucked up, had me thinkin' I would die here for you
Shit got me fucked up, can't believe I was so blinded by you
But I don't wanna cry
Got my finger on the trigger and I'm thinking 'bout a homicide
I feel like I could die
Maybe if it was all over, I could have you in another life

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all of my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Gotta step out, get some fresh air
Posted in the club, saw you pull up with your rebound
Remind me again, uh, who kicked who out whose house?
Remind me again, uh, who's fuckin' on who now? (Oh)
Fightin' for my heart and baby, I never lose
No, I can't get high, 'cause it reminds me of you
If you ever needed me, girl, I was flyin' to you
Told you that I loved you, girl, I wasn't lyin' to you

[Bridge: Juice WRLD]
Fightin' for my heart and baby, I never lose
No, I can't get high, 'cause it reminds me of you
If you ever needed me, girl, I was flyin' to you
Told you that I loved you, girl, I wasn't lyin' to you

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all of my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you

[Intro]
You broke me first

[Verse 1]
Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me
That you were thinking 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party
Or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months
So you're calling me now

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

[Chorus]
Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

[Verse 2]
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever
You know that hurt
Swear, for a while I would stare at my phone
Just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

[Chorus]
Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

[Bridge]
What did you think would happen?
What did you think would happen?
I'll never let you have it
What did you think would happen?

[Chorus]
Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first (You broke me first)
You broke me first, ooh oh

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

[Bridge]
I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Outro]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

[Verse 1]
Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now

[Chorus]
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely

[Post-Chorus]
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid

[Chorus]
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely

[Post-Chorus]
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely

[Verse 1]
Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate

[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

[Verse 2]
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more that they seem to change
Don't ya think it's strange?

[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

[Bridge]
Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

[Outro]
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me, and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Verse]
I can't believe that, you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it
Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone

[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me, and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah-oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you, ooh
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah-oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you, ooh

[Bridge]
It's gon' be hard here on my own
And even harder to let you go, I
Really wish that we, could have got this right

[Pre-Chorus]
So here I go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone (Oh)

[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me, and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah-oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you (No, no, no)

Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough

Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa & Miley Cyrus]
Strung out on a feeling, my hands are tied
Your face on my ceiling, I fantasize

Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe

How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride

Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine

[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

[Bridge]
I couldn't believe it or see it for myself
Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawing, got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely (My baggage fadin')
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away

[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me, ooh (Trust me)
The way that you trust me, baby (Trust me)
'Cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view (Oh)
Yeah

[Intro]
Mm, mm
Mm, mm-mm-mm

[Verse 1]
In the fading light, hearts collide
Shadows dance in the distance
Something just ain't right, I'm cold inside
Help me find what I'm missin'

[Pre-Chorus]
We're all scared to fly, still we try
Learn to be brave, see the other side
Won't you lead me there? Have no fear
Close your eyes, find paradise

[Chorus]
Oh, my, my, my
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my (My, my, my)
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise
Oh, my, my, my (My, my, my)
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my (My, my, my)
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, paradise
Oh, my, my, my
Oh, paradise
Oh, my, my, my
Oh, paradise
Oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

[Verse 2]
When the dark has gone, the morning's won
We're gonna feel something different
It will set you free, if you just tell me
Every secret, I'll listen

[Pre-Chorus]
We're all scared to fly, still we try
Learn to be brave, see the other side
Won't you lead me there? Have no fear
Close your eyes, find paradise
Paradise, paradise
Close your eyes, find paradise
Paradise, paradise
Close your eyes, find para-

[Chorus]
Oh, my, my, my
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my (My, my, my)
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, ah, oh, my, my, my
Oh, ah, oh, my, my, my
Oh, ah, oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da (Jason Derulo)

[Verse 1]
Pull up, skrrt-skrrt on your body
Performin' just like my 'Rari
You're too fine, need a ticket
I bet you taste expensive
Pourin' up, up, up by the liter
If you keepin' up, you's a keeper
Tequila and vodka
Girl, you might be a problem

[Pre-Chorus]
Run away, run away, run away, run away, I know that I should
But my heart wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay now
You can see it in my eyes that I wanna take you down right now if I could
So I hope you know what I mean when I say

[Chorus]
Let me take you dancin'
Two-step to the bedroom
We don't need no dancefloor
Let me see your best move
Anything could happen
Ever since I met you
No need to imagine
Baby, all I'm asking
Is let me take you dancing

[Post-Chorus]
Like da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 2]
Pull up, skrrt-skrrt on your body
It's just us two in this party
That Louis, that Prada
Looks so much better off ya
Turn me up, up, up, be my waitress
Know we not in love, so let's make it
Tequila and vodka
Girl, you might be a problem

[Pre-Chorus]
Run away, run away, run away, run away, I know that I should (Know that I should)
But my heart wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay now
You can see it in my eyes that I wanna take you down right now if I could
So I hope you know what I mean when I say

[Chorus]
Let me take you dancin'
Two-step to the bedroom
We don't need no dancefloor
Let me see your best move
Anything could happen
Ever since I met you
No need to imagine
Baby, all I'm asking
Is let me take you dancing

[Post-Chorus]
Like da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da (Oh)
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da (If you know what I mean)
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da (Girl)
Da-da-da-da-da-da

[Chorus]
Let me take you dancin'
Two-step to the bedroom
We don't need no dancefloor
Let me see your best move
Anything could happen
Ever since I met you
No need to imagine
Baby, all I'm asking
Is let me take you dancing

[Post-Chorus]
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da (Oh, baby)
Da-da-da-da-da-da (Oh, baby)

Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da (Dancin')
