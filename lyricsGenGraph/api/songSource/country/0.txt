[Verse 1]
I was no daddy's dream
Was not your momma's prayer
But I was your first and your
Last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire
When I smoked my bronco tires
Out of that town

[Verse 2]
I'm good at rollin' dice
No good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin'
Life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' wreckless
Nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

[Chorus]
This ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view

[Verse 3]
I paint with my old Gibson
You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars
Chasin' what's in our hearts
Into the blue (Into the blue)

[Chorus]
This ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
A Hell of a view

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
We ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off a ledge
Like we got nothin', we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view

[Outro]
A Hell of a view
A Hell of a view (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
A Hell of a view

[Verse 1]
Are you one of them girls that peels off the Bud Light label? Just might run a pool table?
Roll your eyes if I call you an angel, ain't you one of them girls?
Ask you to dance, you say "No" just to see how far I'll go
Your song comes on and your eyes close, that's when I know, yeah
You got your heart on lock down, got a wall I gotta knock down
Kinda wanna do a shot now, come on now

[Chorus]
And you're one of them girls that ain't tryna meet nobody
You're just here for the party, if I'm wrong then stop me, yeah
You're one of them girls that ain't handin' out your number
You like to make us want you, you like to make us wonder

[Verse 2]
If you're one of them girls, 'cause I'm one of them boys
Would trade his whole world, hm, yeah
For one of them girls who likes to act all quiet, sexy, not even tryin'
Yeah, you know I ain't lyin', damn right
You one of them girls, broke every heart in your hometown
On the day you rode out, got 'em all wishin' on stars now

[Chorus]
If I find one of them girls that ain't tryna meet nobody
You're just here for the party, if I'm wrong then stop me, yeah
You're one of them girls that ain't handin' out your number
You like to make us want you, you like to make us wonder

[Post-Chorus]
If you're one of them girls
Well, I'm one of them boys
Would trade his whole world, hm, yeah
For one of them girls

[Bridge]
You're one of them girls
I wanna put my lips on
Hold all night long
Write a little love song

[Chorus]
For one of them girls that ain't tryna meet nobody
You're just here for the party, if I'm wrong then stop me, yeah
You're one of them girls that ain't handin' out your number
You like to make us want you, you like to make us wonder

[Post-Chorus]
If you're one of them girls
Well, I'm one of them boys
Would trade his whole world, his whole world
For one of them girls

[Outro]
Hmm, one of them girls

[Verse 1]
We were countin' one star at a time
One fell out of the sky
You had your eyes closed, you were wishin' on 'em
I was thinkin' 'bout your lips, girl and kissin' on 'em
We were sittin' in the light of the moon
I was watchin' it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night

[Chorus]
We were down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

[Verse 2]
Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't
'Cause you were lookin' like a dream I've been dreamin'
I was thinkin' 'bout anything but leavin'
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far

[Chorus]
Down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I was saying, "Stay with me
I'll be everything you need"

[Chorus]
We were way past 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

[Outro]
Down to one
I was saying, "Stay with me
I'll be everything you need"
Down to one
Down to one

[Intro]
There are many people who drink in moderation with no problems
Social, moral, or medical
They have learned to enjoy liquor without letting it upset
The functioning of their body and mind
It relaxes you, makes you more congenial (I just had one sip)
This helps make a gathering cheerful and friendly

[Verse 1]
It ain't my fault, so don't blame me
I swear I just came here to unwind and have one drink
The way it looks, it ain't what you think
This Cabernet has a way of vanishing on me

[Chorus]
There's a hole in the bottle leaking all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even supper time
Honey, no, I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine

[Verse 2]
I keep my cool, play by all the rules
I swear ten minutes ago that bottle was full
But I won't cry about love gone wrong
'Cause tears would water down this ruby red I'm sipping on

[Chorus]
There's a hole in the bottle leaking all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even supper time
Honey, no, I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine (Aw, yeah)

[Bridge]
I went and got a new one
'Cause the other one was broken
Now this one's halfway gone
And it's barely even open

[Chorus]
There's a hole in the bottle (Hole in the bottle) leaking all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even supper time
Honey, no, I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine

[Outro]
You may ask me where it's going
But I can't even find
The hole in the bottle of wine
She has abused her system, and she's paying for it

[Chorus]
We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singin' "Dixieland Delight"
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

[Verse 1]
Eighty degrees and the sun ain't even out
We got a spot a couple miles outta town
When that moon comes up, you know what's goin' down
We got them foldin' chairs leanin way back
No other plans other than relax
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow from where we at

[Chorus]
We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singing Dixieland Delight
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

[Verse 2]
Way down here, we all got that Southern drawl
Take our time when we talkin', "Hey Y'all"
Yeah, it don't take much for us to have it all (That's right)
Something 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
We just gonna stay right here and let the world go by

[Chorus]
We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singing Dixieland Delight
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

[Bridge]
Something 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
So we just gonna stay right here and let the world go by

[Chorus]
We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night, al night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine, sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singing Dixieland Delight
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

[Outro]
Tryna catch a good time (Good time)
Good time
Tryna catch a good time
Good time
Yeah, we try to catch a good time (Good time)
Good time (Good time)
Tryna catch a good time (Good time, baby)
Good time
Aw, I think I got a bite

[Verse 1]
A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

[Pre-Chorus]
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Verse 2]
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Outro]
After all

You think you took the sun with you when you walked out
You think you stole the silver lining right out of my clouds
You thought that poppin' my tires would stop me getting around
Naw, you should see me now
No more of you calling and checking up on me
And it feels so good, feels so good

Nothing's better than us not together
'Cause the best kind of me is me without you
Pockets heavy with free time and money
This double, turned single life is going down smooth
We were falling for love, and yeah we thought it was something
Turns out something was nothing
And nothing's better

You thought you took all the good out of that goodbye
I thought I'd bring you your things, but I just left 'em outside
You thought I'd see you looking Friday night fine and want one more try
Naw, oh I'm done being that guy
'Cause the feeling of freedom was watching you leaving
And it feels so good, feels so good

Nothing's better than us not together
'Cause the best kind of me is me without you
Pockets heavy with free time and money
This double turned single life is going down smooth
We were falling for love, and yeah we thought it was something
Turns out something was nothing
And nothing's better
And nothing's better

Nothing's better than us not together
'Cause the best kind of me is me without you
Pockets heavy with free time and money
This double turned single life is going down smooth
We were falling for love, and yeah we thought it was something
Turns out something was nothing
And nothing's better
And nothing's better
And nothing's better
And nothing's better

[Intro: P!nk]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
I don't remember much about last night
Woke up on a couch sun-rise
Saw the living room
Through these bloodshot eyes of mine, cold sober
You didn’t like that I came home late
4 AM but it's a Friday, babe
And I've been working hard
Can't you give me some space 'stead of shouting out, "Oh my God"?

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban & P!nk]
Oh-oh, ooh-yeah
Oh-oh, ooh-yeah
I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me miss you more, more

[Chorus: Keith Urban & P!nk]
I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah
In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone
And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong?
I know I'm proud
But I've had one too many
Come take me home

[Verse 2: P!nk]
So now I'm the one that's crying
I didn't wanna call 'cause I didn't wanna fight
I swear that I was trying, yeah
But everybody falls when their head's a little high
And I've never meant to get so out my mind
With you playing cool, just pretending it's fine
Oh, we've been 'round, 'round, 'round this
Too many times before

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban & P!nk]
Oh-oh, ooh yeah
Oh-oh, ooh yeah
I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me miss you more, more

[Chorus: Keith Urban & P!nk]
I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah
In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone
And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong?
I know I'm proud
But I've had one too many
Come take me home

[Bridge: Keith Urban & P!nk, P!nk]
I don't know how lucky, how lucky I am, I am, I am, no
I guess sometimes I should give more of a damn, a damn, a damn about you
I don't know how lucky, how lucky I am, I am, I am, no
I know we're both stubborn
Push each other's buttons
I'd rather do it with you, but...
I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah
In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone

[Chorus: Keith Urban & P!nk]
I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah
In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone
And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong?
I know I'm proud
But I've had one too many, come take me home

[Outro: Keith Urban & P!nk, P!nk]
Come take me home
Yeah, I've had one too many

[Verse 1]
There's a woman at a table
Keeps looking at her phone
And the fella sitting with her
It's like he'd rather be alone
They're hangin' on by a thread
And that thread's 'bout to go
This might not need to be said
But I just wanna let you know

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna let you go
Baby, I don't wanna know what it's like to lose you (Lose you)
Oh, 'cause people break up, fall in and outta love
But giving this up somehow just won't do (Won't do)
And I don't wanna give you a reason to leave me
Watch you drive off in the night
I never wanna feel that freedom that people say they find
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know what it's like to lose you (To lose you)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know I'm gonna say things that should never leave my mouth
When your world's flyin' off the handle, I'll try keep you on the ground
It won't always be roses, even though you deserve 'em
I wanna make sure you know that what we got is worth it

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna let you go
Baby, I don't wanna know what it's like to lose you (Lose you)
Oh, 'cause people break up, fall in and outta love
But giving this up somehow just won't do (Won't do)
And I don't wanna give you a reason to leave me
Watch you drive off in the night
I never wanna feel that freedom that people say they find
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know what it's like to lose you, yeah
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know

[Bridge]
And I don't wanna wind up like that
Baby, I just wanna make this last
And if we don't watch it, it could happen fast
Put me over us, puts you in the past
And I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know what it's like to lose you

[Chorus 2]
People break up, fall in and outta love
Baby, giving this up somehow just won't do
And I don't wanna give you a reason to leave me
Watch you drive off in the night
I never wanna feel that freedom that people say they find
And I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know what it's like to lose you

[Verse 1]
Your kisses have a higher power
Your body, baby, it's divine
Every time I see you smile
It's like I've seen the light
Sleeping next to you is Heaven
But you already know 'bout that
Wanna glorify every part of you so bad

[Chorus]
Don't get me wrong
I'm a God fearing Christian man
But if you were a religion then, damn
I don't know what I'd do
Yeah, I might have to worship you
I might have to sing your praise
I might have to go to church, yeah
Every single night and day
Yeah, I might have to hit my knees
'Cause you lay it on me like the truth
And you love me like Hallelujah
I might have to worship you
Yeah, I might have to worship you
I might have to worship you (I might have to worship you)

[Verse 2]
And I ain't saying you can walk on water
Or that you can turn it into wine
But, girl, it feels like a miracle that you're mine

[Chorus]
So don't get me wrong
I'm a God fearing Christian man
But if you were a religion then, damn
Yeah, I don't know what I'd do
Yeah, I might have to worship you
I might have to sing your praise
I might have to go to church, yeah
Every single night and day
Yeah, I might have to hit my knees
'Cause you lay it on me like the truth
And you love me like Hallelujah
I might have to worship you
I might have to worship you
Woo
Said I might have to worship you
Don't get me wrong
I'm a God fearing Christian man
But if you were a religion then, damn
Said I don't know what I'd do
Yeah, I might have to worship you
I might have to sing your praise
I might have to go to church, yeah
Every single night and day
I might have to hit my knees
'Cause you lay it on me like the truth
And you love me like Hallelujah
I might have to worship you
Yeah, I might have to worship you
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I might have to worship you (I might have to worship you)

[Verse 1]
We swung our feet off of the edge of the moon
We got that high for a minute
Sometimes forever gets away from you
No matter how hard you grip it

[Pre-Chorus]
Sorry the sky fell down
Sorry I don't know why
All we do is apologize

[Chorus]
Oh, but I'll never be sorry for my hands in the pockets
Of your hoodie, called you "Sugar" just to make you smile
And I'll never be sorry for the shoes that I bought you
In Chicago, we were walking down the Miracle Mile
Oh I, oh I

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry
I'll never be sorry for loving you
I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry
I'll never be sorry for loving you

[Verse 2]
Sometimes two people end up victims of love
It don't work out like you planned it (Oh, no, no, no)
Just 'cause we couldn't get the stars to line up
Don't mean we leave empty-handed

[Pre-Chorus]
Sorry the sun came up
Sorry the second verse
Just wasn't as sweet as the first

[Chorus]
Oh, but I'll never be sorry for that night in Santa Barbara
We got locked out of your car in the pouring rain
And I'll never be sorry for missing the party
'Cause the way your body looked in that dress blew me away
Oh I, oh I

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry
I'll never be sorry for loving you
I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry
I'll never be sorry for loving you

[Bridge]
Oh I, oh I

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry
I'll never be sorry, baby
I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry
I'll never be sorry for loving you

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'll never be sorry for my hands in the pockets
Of your hoodie, called you "Sugar" just to make you smile
Yeah, I'll never be sorry for the shoes that I bought you
In Chicago, we were walking down the Miracle Mile
Oh I, oh I

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry
I'll never be sorry for loving you
I'll never be sorry, I'll never be sorry
I'll never be sorry for loving you
I'll never be sorry

[Verse 1]
I've got this feeling
And I've got this shovel
Between me and you and it
You're in a little trouble
I saw you sneakin'
And I know what happened
I think it's kinda funny you got caught
Only I ain't laughin'

[Chorus]
Martha Divine
Martha Divine
You put your hands on the wrong damn man this time
Jezebel
You're bound for Hell
But evidently the Devil's busy
So I moved you up in line
Martha Divine

[Verse 2]
Well, you call him darlin'
And I call him daddy
And daddy says he'll whoop me if I don't keep mama happy
Honor thy father, honor thy mother
Lord, the Bible doesn't say a damn thing about your daddy's lover

[Chorus]
Martha Divine
Martha Divine
You put your hands on the wrong damn man this time
Jezebel
You're bound for Hell
But evidently the Devil's busy
So I moved you up in line
Martha Divine

[Bridge]
Mama's an angel
My daddy isn't
Looks like a little more of him rubbed off on me than didn't
Well, I'll leave you to it
They'll never prove it
And if they ever find out, I'll say, "The Devil made me do it"

[Chorus]
Martha Divine
Martha Divine
You put your hands on the wrong damn man this time
Martha Divine
Your ass is mine
And it ain't murder if I bury you alive
Martha Divine

[Verse 1]
A 'Bama red 4Runner pulled into the party
With a 30-A sticker on the back windshield
Two-tone tank top slippin' off her shoulder
Kinda girl when she steps out, the world stands still
Ooh, I know where this is goin'
I already know it

[Chorus]
She's somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine

[Verse 2]
Kinda girl once you've had her, you can't stand to lose her
Kinda girl where your friends tell you don't F it up
Kinda girl that goes from tryin' to just to get her number
To slidin' through the summer to talkin' 'bout love
Ooh, I think I'm likin' where it's goin'
I'd like to try me some of

[Chorus]
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine

[Bridge]
Oh, hey baby, don't just keep me wishin'
Oh, let me get to fixin'

[Chorus]
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine
About to be mine
About to be mine

[Verse 1]
Every night at 12 o'clock (At 12 o'clock)
On the dot, it never fails, you call me up (Call me up)
Talkin' 'bout you had a bad day, so you're pullin' up (Pullin' up)
So I pour up a cup of just what you need
'Cause I know what you need

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it when you wanna sleep at my place
I love it when we dancing down the hallway
But when you leave, it puts me in a bad place
Will you stay? Come on, please stay

[Chorus]
You come around unannounced and you leave with the sunlight
Just when it's gettin' good, you hit me with the goodbye
Same thing every night, I can never get enough time
I want more of ya
I want more of that moonlight, that candlelight, that red wine
(It's gone too soon)
And you're sitting there with your fingertips, you're lingerin'

[Verse 2]
You ain't going nowhere
My t-shirt, you're still In it
Been on your phone for a minute
Baby, who you kiddin'?
Girl, we're runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' from the truth
I know you want me too, so why do you?

[Chorus]
You come around unannounced and you leave with the sunlight
Just when it's gettin' good, you hit me with the goodbye
Same thing every night, I can never get enough time
I want more of ya
I want more of that moonlight, that candlelight, that red wine
(It's gone too soon)
Yeah, it's gone too soon
It's gone too soon

[Bridge]
Girl, we're runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' from the truth
But we don’t have to, so you don’t have to

[Chorus]
You come around unannounced and you leave with the sunlight
Just when it's gettin' good, you hit me with the goodbye
Same thing every night, I can never get enough time
I want more of ya
I want more of that moonlight, that candlelight, that red wine
(It's gone too soon)

[Outro]
Ooh yeah, it's gone too soon
(I want more of that moonlight, that candlelight, that red wine)
Gone too soon

[Verse 1]
I didn't think I was a bad guy
I knew that you were good
You were golden on the inside
And you loved me the best you could
I'm the one who dropped the ball
Got you high and let you fall
Let the best thing I ever had slip away

[Chorus]
What does that say about me
That I could do you like I did
That I could break an angel's wings
What does that say about me
That I stood there like a fencepost
As you drove off in your car
What does that say about me
Now that I've broke your pretty heart
Your pretty heart

[Verse 2]
I've been drinking like a drunkard
In these Austin neon light
Burning smoke and wondering
If there's anything I've done right
Well I wish that I could go back
Hang on to what I had
Guess that's all, babe
Nothing but a dream

[Chorus]
What does that say about me
That I could do you like I did
That I could break an angel's wings
What does that say about me
That I stood there like a fencepost
As you drove off in your car
What does that say about me
Now that I've broke your pretty heart
Your pretty heart

[Chorus]
What does that say about me
That I could do you like I did
That I could break an angel's wings
What does that say about me
That I stood there like a fencepost
As you drove off in your car
What does that say about me
Now that I've broke your pretty heart
Your pretty heart
Your pretty heart
Your pretty heart

[Verse 1]
I had one saying we were done
In a Baton Rouge college bar
It kinda came out of nowhere
Man, I took that one pretty hard (That one pretty hard)
And I had another one in another town
And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture

[Chorus]
So here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the "hey, I think we need to talk"
And the "it ain't me, it's you" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes

[Verse 2]
Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me (Mama loved her more than me)
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason

[Chorus]
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the "hey, I think we need to talk"
And the "it ain't me, it's you" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (Yeah, the almost maybes)

[Bridge]
Wouldn't be no all alones
Wouldn't be no sad songs
Wouldn't be no had enough
Pick yourself up and get to moving ons
From the didn't work outs
The girls next door and the bat shit crazies
There wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes

[Chorus]
Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the "hey, I think we need to talk"
And the "it ain't me, it's you" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (Almost maybes)

[Outro]
No, it wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes

[Verse 1]
Tail lights don't lie
Didn't even have to say goodbye
Can't go home, so I'll just stay here
Find a way to make you disappear
Take a shortcut to the jukebox
To a barstool and a double shot
I'm smokin' even though I quit

[Chorus]
I need a song to remember
And a drink to forget
I'm on my way to gettin' over you
But I ain't there yet
When the melody hits me
Little Coke in my whiskey
I'm as close to good as I'm gonna get
I need a song to remember
And a drink to forget

[Verse 2]
Song has faded, glass is empty
Halfway to okay that you ain't here with me
I can't decide if I miss you tonight
Or I'm glad that you're gone, hell, I guess

[Chorus]
I need a song to remember
And a drink to forget, yeah
I'm on my way to gettin' over you
But I ain't there yet
Oh, when the melody hits me
Little Coke in my whiskey
I'm as close to good as I'm gonna get
I need a song to remember
And a drink to forget

[Bridge]
Take a shortcut to the jukebox
To a barstool to the double shot
You're runnin' in and outta my head

[Chorus]
I need a song to remember
And a drink to forget
Yeah, I'm on my way to gettin' over you
Oh, but I ain't there yet
Yeah, when the melody hits me
Little Coke in my whiskey
I'm as close to good as I'm gonna get
I need a song to remember
And a drink to forget
A song to remember
And a drink to forget
Hey

[Verse 1: Chris Young]
My buddy Brandon holds the record
For single-season touchdown throws
And good ol' Johnny, he's the life of every party
It's like Cheers they know him everywhere he goes

[Chorus: Chris Young & Kane Brown]
I've got some famous friends, you've probably never heard of
But back in Rutherford County, our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends
Yeah I do

[Verse 2: Kane Brown]
My buddy Jason, he's the sheriff
He'll flash his lights but let me go
My boy Randy, he's a preacher
My girl Megan, she's been teacher of the year
I swear for five years in a row

[Chorus: Chris Young & Kane Brown]
I've got some famous friends, you've probably never heard of
But back in Hamilton County, our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends
Yeah I do

[Bridge: Kane Brown & Chris Young]
I got friends in high places, on these small town roads
'Cause 'round here it's all about the people that you know

[Chorus: Chris Young & Kane Brown]
I've got some famous friends, you've probably never heard of
But back in Davidson County, our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends
Yeah I do

[Outro: Chris Young & Kane Brown]
Yeah I do
You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends, yeah
I've got some famous friends (I've got some famous friends)
Yeah

Dark hair and a white magnolia
Subway in New York City
Makin' out on a basement sofa
Staircase and prom-dress pretty

Bonfires and a letterman jacket
Rope swings and small-town summers
Front porch, first-kiss magic
Backseat and brand-new lovers

Every sunset has a sunrise and
Every firework has a July
Every left needs a right hand to hold
Just one of those things
That you don't know why
But it just feels right
You and I go together like
Ooh ooh ooh

Two names in a concrete driveway
Cracker Jacks and a baseball game
Tin roof and the pourin' rain
Your voice sayin' my name

Every sunset has a sunrise and
Every firework has a July
Every left needs a right hand to hold
Just one of those things
That you don't know why
But it just feels right
You and I go together like
Ooh ooh ooh

Bendy straw and cherry cola
My head leanin' on your shoulder
That same joke that your grandpa told ya
Hands up on a roller coaster

Every sunset has a sunrise and
Every firework has a July
Every left needs a right hand to hold
Just one of those things
That you don't know why
But it just feels right
You and I go together like
Ooh ooh ooh

We go, we go together like that
Just like that
Baby, baby, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's a Friday night, we circled up
It's going down 'round these pick up trucks
Yeah, it's cold cans and Dixie cups
Just out here doin' what we've always done

[Chorus]
Long live all the small towners, sunup to sundowners
That old school Haggard and Hank
Long live longneck bottles and wide-open throttles
And old dirt roads with no name
Long live them country girls, long legs and cut up jeans
Long live this way of life, long live nights like these
Long live, long live, long live
Long live nights like these

[Verse 2]
Long live the Walmart, parking lot
Turning to the midnight party spot
Long live hard work, when it pays off
And living it up on your days off

[Chorus]
Long live all the small towners, sunup to sundowners
That old school Haggard and Hank
Long live longneck bottles and wide-open throttles
And old dirt roads with no name
Long live them country girls, long legs and cut up jeans
Long live this way of life, long live nights like these
Long live, long live, long live
Long live nights like these

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Long live them glory days, on them back forty days
All them pass it 'round, pass it down story days

[Chorus]
Long live all the small towners, sunup to sundowners
That old school Haggard and Hank
Long live longneck bottles and wide-open throttles
And old dirt roads with no name
Long live them country girls, long legs and cut up jeans
Long live this way of life, long live nights like these
Long live, long live, long live
Long live nights like these

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you used to talk about
Getting even further South
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now
Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house

[Chorus]
But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet
Of a good old boy like me
'Cause I still
Go drinkin', same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way anyway

[Chorus]
But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Seven summers ago (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Seven summers ago (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Seven summers ago (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Seven summers ago (Ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
Should I give up sunsets for marigold mornings?
Should I look for rainbows or wait for the rain?
Is happiness on the highway? Or is it parked in the driveway?
Should I lean on you, babe? Or should you lean on me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

[Chorus]
I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

[Verse 2]
I could plant a pretty garden, just send myself flowers
Be a jet-set Friday or a Sunday hometown girl
I could stay a little lonely or let you get to know me
Yeah, I could love a picket fence if it wrapped around the world

[Chorus]
I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
I'm one heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

[Chorus]
I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
A caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? (Ooh, ooh)
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Dad sold every record he ever owned
Floyd and Zeppelin, Beatles, Stones
A lifetime of music gone just to get me through
Momma always had her a second job
Gone with the sun until six o’clock
Whatever it took to get by she was gonna do
Didn’t dawn on me back then but now I see
Without them, I wouldn’t be me

[Chorus]
When I’m up here on this stage
The spotlight’s on my face
But I see you
Sure it’s me behind this mic stand
It’s me strumming this Gibson
It’s me they love to give the credit to
But me don’t mean a thing without you

[Verse 2]
You make sacrifices every night and day
Never hear the crowd scream your name
But there’s a smile and a hand to hold when the show is through
I’d give it all up just to keep your love
But you wouldn’t let me because you care too much
About watching me watch my dreams all come true

[Chorus]
When I’m up here on this stage
The spotlight’s on my face
But I see you
Sure it’s me behind this mic stand
It’s me strumming this Gibson
It’s me they love to give the credit to
But me don’t mean a thing without you

[Verse 3]
You worked overtime to buy those tickets
The gas, the beer and the babysitters
Just to spend one night with your baby at a country show
Paid twenty damn dollars for a place to park
Got in line early to grab your spot
So you deserve every word, every line of your favorite tune

[Chorus]
When I’m up here on this stage
The spotlight’s on my face
But I see you
Sure it’s me behind this mic stand
It’s me strumming this Gibson
It’s me they love to give the credit to
I’m just trying to give the credit where credit’s due
Because me don’t mean a thing without you
Without you

[Verse 1]
Just look at her sittin' there
Sweatpants, t-shirt, in her comfy chair, hmm
Her hair in a bun, one hand on a mug
And the other one's playin' snare
To a George Strait vinyl, that yes-or-no line will get her close
But I don't think she can understand
Just how far I've been lettin' my heart fall
But what's in my head

[Chorus]
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin' like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand

[Post-Chorus]
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know

[Verse 2]
Well, she don't know I already bought a ring
Hid it in the bottom left drawer, right beside the sink
A shiny emerald diamond on a brand-new band
Asked her mama for permission and her daddy for her hand

[Chorus]
I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin' like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand

[Post-Chorus]
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know

[Bridge]
Well, here I go
'Cause right now, we're back in her hometown
And I'm down on one knee
I guess she finally figured out
I'm gonna ask her to marry me

[Chorus]
I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin' like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand

[Post-Chorus]
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know

[Verse 1]
Usually I'm put together
Most the time I'm fine
Normally I break up better
But, baby, not this time

[Pre Chorus]
Yeah, I don't know what to do about it
I'm laying in bed about it (I'm laying in bed about it)
Yeah, I'm tryna keep my cool about it
Get up out my head about it (Get up out my head about it)

[Chorus]
But baby, I'm still broken up about it
Yeah, I've had it up to here, had enough about it
Maybe I will open up about it
Yeah, but only if I drink until I'm drunk about it
Lord knows, I wish that I could say that I'll be fine
But, baby, I'm still broken up about it (Baby, I'm still broken up about it)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I guess that karma knows my name
'Cause she called me up the other night
Momma always knew just what to say
But now she ain't on my side

[Pre Chorus]
'Cause I'm the one to blame about it
I'm the one that messed it up (I'm the one that messed it up)
Yeah, I deserve the pain about it
Wish that I could give you up
But I'm still in love

[Chorus]
Yeah, baby, I'm still broken up about it
Yeah, I've had it up to here, had enough about it
Maybe I will open up about it
Yeah, but only if I drink until I'm drunk about it
Lord knows I wish that I could say that I'll be fine
But, baby, I'm still broken up about it (Baby, I'm still broken up about it)

[Bridge]
Yeah, time will change but I'll still feel the same
Might take a week, a month, a year
But I'll still feel, I'll still feel the same
Aww yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, baby, I'm still broken up about it
(Still broken up about it)
Baby, I'm still broken up about it
(Baby, I'm still broken up about it)


Yeah, baby, I'm still broken up about it
Yeah, I've had it up to here, had enough about it
Maybe I will open up about it
Yeah, but only if I drink until I'm drunk about it
Lord knows, I wish that I could say that I'll be fine
But, baby, I'm still broken up about it
Baby, I'm still broken up about it


I'm still, I'm still broken
I'm still, I'm still broken
I'm still, I'm still broken
I'm still, I'm still broken

[Outro]
Don't know what to do about it
Still broken up about it
Yeah, I'm tryna keep my cool about it
Baby, I'm still broken up about it

[Verse 1]
I still smell the smoke from the fourth of July fireworks
And I still feel the kick drum front row at the concert
After Talladega safe to say you stick around
We were both drunk at the party when I told you that I loved you
You laughed like I was crazy but I swear, girl that's when I knew
What we had, looking back on it right now

[Chorus]
That last call first kiss never left my mind
That old school Springsteen gets me every time
And when I see that leather jacket
I think about how you had it
Wrapped around your shoulder
That whole October
And that sunset barefoot fire on the beach
I can still feel your hands all over me
And when the sky lights up
Girl, it's your shade of blue
'Cause every other memory
Every other memory is you

[Verse 2]
Girl, you're every other turn down, every back road in my head
And even though it's over you're still playing hard to forget
Close my eyes and there you are
Still underneath the stars

[Chorus]
'Cause that last call first kiss never left my mind
That old school Springsteen gets me every time
And when I see that leather jacket
I think about how you had it
Wrapped around your shoulder
That whole October
And that sunset barefoot fire on the beach
I can still feel your hands all over me
And when the sky lights up
Girl, it's your shade of blue
'Cause every other memory
Every other memory is you

[Break]
Girl, it's you
Every other memory is you and me
Wrapped up in the summer
There will never be another
Never be another

[Chorus]
Like that last call first kiss never left my mind
And that old school Springsteen gets me every time
And when I see that leather jacket
I think about how you had it
Wrapped around your shoulder
That whole October
And that sunset barefoot fire on the beach
I can still feel your hands all over me
And when the sky lights up
Girl, it's your shade of blue
'Cause every other memory
Every other memory is you

[Outro]
Girl, it's you
Every other memory is you and me
Tangled in the summer
There will never be another
Never be another
Like that last call first kiss

[Verse 1]
Red leaves on the river
Footprints in the sand
Cold walk in December
Warming up your hands
Sun dress on the front steps
Sun up by the lake
Blanket down in the backyard
Lying wide awake

[Chorus]
That's a memory I don't mess with
The girl I was the best with
The one I was obsessed with
Girl, you just don't get it
I'd fall right back with one slip
Always leaves me helpless
Don't hate me, I can't help it
Gotta leave us where we left it
You're a memory I don't mess with

[Verse 2]
Moonlight on the back seat
A breeze through the wires
Springsteen on the speakers
Girl, I'm on fire
That's stuff I don't think about
'Cause it still kills me now
I still can't dance around

[Chorus]
That memory I don't mess with
The girl I was the best with
The one I was obsessed with
Girl, you just don't get it
I'd fall right back with one slip
Always leaves me helpless
Don't hate me, I can't help it
Gotta leave us where we left it
You're a memory I don't mess with

[Bridge]
It's good running into you like this
But, girl, I'm close as I can get

[Chorus]
To a memory I don't mess with
The girl I was the best with
The one I was obsessed with
Girl, you just don't get it
I'd fall right back with one slip
Always leaves me helpless
Don't hate me, I can't help it
Gotta leave us where we left it
You're a memory I don't mess with

[Outro]
Red leaves on the river
Footprints in the sand
Cold walk in December
Warming up your hands
