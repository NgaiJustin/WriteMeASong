[Verse 1]
Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey, yay

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift, I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey, yay

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

[Outro]
A denial, a denial
A denial, a denial
A denial, a denial
A denial, a denial
A denial

[Verse 1]
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

[Pre-Chorus]
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'

[Chorus]
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du

[Verse 2]
Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

[Chorus]
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-oh, ra-ra

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like My only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am together we cry

[Verse 2]
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city, she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah
One time

[Outro]
(Under the bridge downtown)
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away, yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah
Oh no, I said oh, yeah yeah
Here I stay

[Verse 1]
Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now, you should have somehow realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Verse 2]
Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

[Chorus]
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

[Verse 3]
Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you
By now, you should've somehow realised what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

[Chorus]
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

[Outro]
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me

[Instrumental Outro]

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin
'Til the Sandman he comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land

[Verse 2]
Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragons' fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Now, I lay me down to sleep (Now, I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep (Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
And if I die before I wake (If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take (Pray the Lord my soul to take)
Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet, in your head

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land (yeah, haha haha)

[Outro]
Oh, yeah-yeah, yo
We're off to never never-land
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land

[Verse 1]
Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old memoria

[Refrain]
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria

[Verse 2]
Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old memoria

[Refrain]
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria

[Chorus]
And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria (No, I don't have a gun)

[Chorus]
And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun

[Refrain]
Memoria
Memoria

[Verse 1]
'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony that's life
Trying to make ends meet, you're a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
Where all the veins meet, yeah

[Chorus 1]
No change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould
I am here in my mould
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Have you ever been down?)

[Verse 2]
Well I've never prayed, but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now

[Chorus 2]
No change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould
I am here in my mould
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould
No, no, no, no, no
Have you ever been down?
I can't change it you know, I can't change it

[Verse 3]
'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, that's life
Trying to make ends meet
Trying to find somebody, then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
Where all the veins meet, yeah

[Chorus 3 + Outro]
You know I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould
I am here in my mould
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
You've gotta change my mould, no, no, no
(It's just sex and violence, melody and silence)
(Gotta, can't change my violence, melody and silence)
(Gotta can't change my violence, melody and silence)
(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)
(Gotta, can't change my violence, melody and silence)
(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)
(Gotta, can't change my violence, melody and silence)
Been down
Ever been down
(Can't change my violence, melody and silence)
Ever been down
Ever been down
Ever been down
Have you ever been down?
Have you ever been down?
Have you ever been down?

[Verse 1]
In my eyes, indisposed
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
In the sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again

[Chorus]
Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come? Won't you come?

[Verse 2]
Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind, tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away
No one sings like you anymore

[Chorus]
Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

[Post-Chorus]
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Hang my head, drown my fear
Till you all just disappear

[Chorus]
Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

[Post-Chorus]
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come?

[Intro]
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!

[Verse 1]
I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is, no

[Chorus]
(Woohoo!) When I feel heavy metal
(Woohoo!) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woohoo!) Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you

[Verse 2]
I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

[Chorus]
(Woohoo!) When I feel heavy metal
(Woohoo!) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woohoo!) Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger than you and you are not me
The lengths that I will go to the distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up

[Pre-Chorus]
That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you and I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough

[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

[Verse 2]
Every whisper of every waking hour I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Consider this, consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this the slip that brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come flailing around?
Now I've said too much

[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

[Bridge]
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you and I don't know if I can do it
Oh now, I've said too much, I haven't said enough

[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

[Outro]
But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try?
That was just a dream, just a dream
Just a dream, dream

[Verse 1]
Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
Junebug skippin' like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end
To it all

[Chorus]
And I don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

[Verse 2]
Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues
Down to see

[Chorus 2]
That we don't even care
As restless as we are
We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement

[Bridge]
Lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

[Verse 3]
Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it
To see

[Chorus 1]
That we don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

[Outro]
The street heats the urgency of now
As you see there's no one around

[Verse 1]
And I feel that time's a wasted go
So where ya goin' 'til tomorrow?
And I see that these are lies to come
So would you even care?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel it
And I feel it

[Chorus]
Where ya goin' for tomorrow?
Where ya goin' with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

[Verse 2]
And I feel, so much depends on the weather
So is it rainin' in your bedroom?
And I see, that these are the eyes of disarray
So would you even care?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel it
And she feels it

[Chorus]
Where ya goin' for to tomorrow?
Where ya goin' with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

[Bridge]
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it

[Chorus]
Where ya goin' for tomorrow?
Where ya goin' with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

[Outro]
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
To find it
To find it
To find it

[Verse 1]
All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating

[Chorus]
Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

[Post-Chorus]
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na

[Verse 2]
Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares

[Chorus]
Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

[Post-Chorus]
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill

[Outro]
(Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
Say it ain't so, I will not go
(Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
Turn the lights off, carry me home
(Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
(Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
The night will go on, the night will go on, my little windmill

[Verse 1]
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

[Verse 2]
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

[Outro]
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

[Verse 1]
In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat
Someone came in saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Double barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

[Verse 2]
The forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey-neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can’t relate
Trade the cash for the beat for the body for the heat
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters

[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Get crazy with the cheese whiz)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Drive-by body pierce)

[Bridge]
(Yo, bring it on down)

I'm a driver, I'm a winner
Things are gonna change, I can feel it

[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(I can't believe you)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Sprechen Sie Deutsch, eh, baby?)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Know what I'm sayin'?)

[Verse 1]
You and me, we used to be together
Every day together, always
I really feel that I'm losin' my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end
It looks as though you're lettin' go
And if it's real, well, I don't want to know

[Chorus]
Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak, I know what you're thinkin'
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

[Verse 2]
Our memories, well, they can be inviting
But some are altogether mighty frightening
As we die, both you and I
With my head in my hands, I sit and cry

[Chorus]
Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts (No, no, no)
Don't speak, I know what you're thinkin'
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

[Bridge]
It's all ending
We gotta stop pretending who we are

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You and me
I can see us dyin', aren't we?

[Chorus]
Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
No, no, don't speak, I know what you're thinkin'
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

[Outro]
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
I know what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't speak, don't speak, don't speak, no
I know what you're thinkin'
And I don't need your reasons
I know you're good, I know you're good
I know you're real good, oh
La, la, la, la, la, la
Don't, don't, ooh, ooh
Hush, hush, darling
Hush, hush, darling
Hush, hush
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Hush, hush, darling
Hush, hush, darling
Hush, hush
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Oh, hush, hush, darling
Hush, hush, darling

[Verse 1]
Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

[Chorus]
No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

[Verse 2]
Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

[Chorus]
No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around

[Intro]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

[Verse 1]
I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over, I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert
Now I know I'm being used
That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem

[Chorus]
Oh hey yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
We make plans to go out at night
I wait 'til two, then I turn out the light
This rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up, I just might tell her so

[Chorus]
Oh hey yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

[Bridge]
When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care
Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Now I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night, she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score
Now I know I should say no
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem

[Chorus]
Oh hey yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

[Bridge]
When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care
Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

[Chorus]
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

[Verse 2]
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out

[Chorus]
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing you've had has gone away

[Chorus]
So don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
And I, I can't help but ask myself
How much I let the fear take the wheel and steer

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's driven me before
And it seems to have a vague, haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm
Beginning to find that I should be the one behind the wheel

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there

[Verse 2]
So if I decide to waiver my chance
To be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?
Oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's driven me before
And it seems to be the way, that everyone else gets around
But lately I'm
Beginning to find that when I drive myself, my light is found

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Would you choose water over wine?
Hold the wheel and drive

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there

[Verse 1]
At home drawin' pictures of mountain tops
With him on top, lemon yellow sun
Arms raised in a "V"
And the dead lay in pools of maroon below

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy didn't give attention
Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world

[Chorus]
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

[Verse 2]
Clearly, I remember picking on the boy
Seemed a harmless little fuck
Ooh, but we unleashed a lion
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast
How could I forget? And he hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurting, ooh, dropped wide open
Just like the day, oh, like the day I heard

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy didn't give affection, no
And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world

[Chorus]
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

[Bridge]
Try to forget this (Try to forget this)
Try to erase this (Try to erase this)
From the blackboard

[Chorus]
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in class today

[Outro]
(Spoke in, spoke in)
(Spoke in, spoke in, spoke in, spoke in...)
(Spoke in, spoke in)
Ooh oh, oh
Ooh oh, oh (Spoke in...)

[Intro]
Oh yeah...
Alright...

[Verse 1]
Somebody's Heine is crowding my icebox
Somebody's cold one is giving me chills
Guess I'll just close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah, alright...
Feels good inside...

[Verse 2]
Flip on the telly, wrestle with Jimmy
Something is bubbling behind my back
The bottle is ready to blow

[Chorus]
Say it ain't so, your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so, my love is a life taker

[Verse 3]
I can't confront you, I never could do
That which might hurt you, so try and be cool
When I say, "this way is a water slide away from me
That takes you further every day," so be cool

[Chorus]
Say it ain't so, your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so, my love is a life taker

[Bridge]
Dear daddy, I write you, in spite of years of silence
You've cleaned up, found Jesus, things are good, or so I hear
This bottle of Stephen's awakens ancient feelings
Like father, stepfather, the son is drowning in the flood
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Say it ain't so, your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so, my love is a life taker

[Verse 1]
There was a time
When I was so broken hearted
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
'Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind
Now listen
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed

[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm trying to forget you
Love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dying 'cause I let you
Do what you do down on me

[Bridge]
Now there's not even breathing room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah, you cry when we're making love
Must be one and the same

[Verse 2]
It's down on me
Yeah I got to tell you one thing
It's been on my mind
Girl, I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain something
What you give to me
Takes my breath away
Now the word out on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist

[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm trying to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dying 'cause I let you
Do what you do to me

[Bridge II]
'Cause what you got inside
Ain't where your love should stay
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love
'Til you give your heart away

[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' to let you
Do what you do what you do down to me
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do down to , down to, down to, down to
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' to forget you
Your love is sweet
I was cryin' when I met you
