[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

[Outro]
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (Ah, oh, ah, oh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I really want, baby, ooh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I want, all I really want is you)

[Intro]
Ah, aha
Ooh, ohh
Ohh

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

[Verse 2]
"Merry Christmas" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby

[Verse 3]
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave me away)
This year, to save me from tears (Ohh)
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Outro]
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Special...
Someone...

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be here
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Oh, woah

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me, boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Outro]
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa, baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be, if he won't be here)
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop

[Verse 2]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

[Verse 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

[Chorus]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Hook]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

[Hook 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Outro]
Sure it's Christmas once more

[Verse 1]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now, the jingle hop has begun

[Verse 2]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

[Bridge]
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

[Verse 2]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

[Bridge]
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

[Outro]
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock

[Chorus]
It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you "be of good cheer"
It's the most wonderful time of the year

[Verse 1]
It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all

[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

[Chorus]
It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time of the year

[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

[Chorus]
It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time of the year

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Verse 1]
Tonight, I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday
Alone to celebrate

[Pre-Chorus]
But then, one day, everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Verse 2]
I found what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

[Saxophone Solo]

[Bridge]
And then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree, yeah

[Chorus]
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing (Oh, yeah, yeah)
It just wasn't the same (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight (Oh, you're all I need)
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight (Underneath the tree)
You're all that I need (Underneath the tree, yeah)
Underneath the tree, tonight
Oh, you're all I need
Underneath, underneath the tree

[Verse 1]
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring tingle tingling too
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "Yoo hoo!"

[Verse 2]
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Were snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding!)

[Verse 1]
You shake me up and turn me upside down
Just like a snow globe
And every time you touch me
I shiver right down to my toes
You got a strange effect on me
You know you make me feel so

[Chorus]
Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

[Verse 2]
Outside it's coming down
But here inside, it's warming up so
When you take your time
You turn me on and make my life glow
You got a strange effect on me
You make me feel so

[Chorus]
Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

[Bridge]
The winter is so gray, feels like the ice is here to stay
But when you look at me, you know you melt it all away

[Chorus]
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart
Oh, so glittery
I love the way you decorate my heart

Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say Hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year

[Instrumental]

Oh, ho, the mistletoe

And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year

[Verse 1]
It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

[Chorus]
(With you) Shawty, with you
(With you) Shawty, with you
(With you) Under the mistletoe

[Verse 2]
Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling with my folks, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
Word on the street, Santa's coming tonight
Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

[Chorus]
(With you) Shawty, with you
(With you) Shawty, with you
(With you) Under the mistletoe
(With you) Shawty, with you

Ayy love, the wise men followed the star
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle
Ayy love, don't you buy me nothing
'Cause I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
That's a merry, merry Christmas

[Verse 1]
It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow

I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Santa Baby, just slip a sable under the tree for me
Been an awful good girl, santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa Baby a 54 convertible too light blue
I'll wait up for you, dear Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the Fella's that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check out my Christmas list

[Verse 2]
Santa Baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa Honey, one little thing I really need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa cutie, fill my stocking with a duplex and checks
Sign your 'X' on the line, Santa cutie
And hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

[Verse 3]
Santa Baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring - I don't mean on the phone, Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry, tonight

[Paul Young]
It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade

[Boy George]
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

[George Michael]
But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard
But when you're having fun

[Simon LeBon (Duran Duran)]n
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

[Sting]
Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears

[Bono & Sting]
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom

[Bono]
Well tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you

[Boy George & Others]
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life (Oooh)
Where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

[Marilyn & Glenn Gregory]
Here's to you

[Paul Young]
Raise a glass for everyone

[Marilyn & Glenn Gregory]
Here's to them

[Paul Young, Marilyn & Glenn Gregory]
Underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

[Chorus: All]
Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

[Verse 1]
I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget what you did last December
You left my heart a mess
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah (It's The Rascals!)

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 2]
Thought we belong together
At least that's what you said
I should have known better
You broke my heart again
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

[Bridge]
How could you leave Christmas morning?
You broke my heart with no warning
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

[Outro]
This is our last, last Christmas
You broke my heart
Last, last Christmas
You broke my heart
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget what you did last December
You left my heart a mess
You blew it
You do it, do it?

[Chorus 1: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby it's cold outside

[Verse 1: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really, I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour
The neighbours might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say, no, no, no sir
Oh, mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?

[Chorus 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I really can't stay
But baby, don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside!
I simply must go
But baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no, no, no
Aw baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Um gosh, your lips are delicious
And my brother will be there at the door
Waves on a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh gosh, your lips are so delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
Oh never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But baby, you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
Oh up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But you don't see, no, no
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you cought pneumonia and died

[Chorus 3: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
But I really can't stay
Get over that whole doubt
But baby it's cold outside!

[Chorus: Frank Sinatra]
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Verse 1: Frank Sinatra]
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

[Verse 2. Frank Sinatra]
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Bridge: Swanson Quartet & (Frank Sinatra)]
He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting by the fire's gloosy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says, "Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow"
(Let It Snow!)
Oooooh-Wee goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says, "Let it snow, let it snow"
(I Don't Care!)

[Chorus: Frank Sinatra & (Swanson Quartet)]
The weather outside Is frightful
But that fire Is ummm... delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are way down low
So let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
(Let it snow!)

[Verse 1: Frank Sinatra]
When we've finally say goodnight
How I'll hate going out In a storm
But If you'll only hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

[Verse 2: All]
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbying
Long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

I'm driving home for Christmas
Oh, I can't wait to see those faces
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah
Well, I'm moving down that line

And it's been so long
But I will be there
I sing this song
To pass the time away

Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas

It's gonna take some time but I'll get there
Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
But soon there'll be a freeway, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through
And feel you near me

Driving in my car
I'm driving home for Christmas
Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories

I take look at the driver next to me
He's just the same
Just the same

Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through
Oh and feel you near me

Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas
Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories

I take look at the driver next to me
He's just the same
He's driving home, driving home
Driving home for Christmas

Driving home for Christmas

[Verse 1]
We were warm and wonderful
Once upon a time
But now we're frozen, hanging by a thread
Can we wait a minute?
Or can we just try to try?
'Cause my favorite day is coming up ahead

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year
That makes us lose our way, just say we'll make up
And hold on a little longer
Don't have me spending it alone
This time of year is precious
Please, can we make it to Christmas?
Can we make it to Christmas?

[Chorus]
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on, ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas

[Verse 2]
Don't know what I'll say to Dad when he sees the empty chair
Don't want to hear my mom say, "Told you so"
Waiting for Santa in my bed is no fun if you're not there
And I don't want to be angry at mistletoes

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year
That makes us lose our way, just say we'll make up
And hold on a little longer
Don't have me spending it alone
This time of year is precious
Please, can we make it to Christmas?
Can we make it to Christmas?

[Chorus]
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on, ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on, ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas

[Bridge]
Darling, I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year
That makes us lose our way, just say we'll make up
And hold on a little longer
Don't have me spending it alone
This time of year is precious
Break my heart on Boxing Day
Just, please, can we make it to Christmas?

[Chorus]
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on, ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas (Yeah)
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on, ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas

[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah

[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"

[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Where every wish comes true
I love you

[Verse 1]
Build yourself a boat, babe
Make yourself a sail
Float into the ocean
To nowhere
Yeah, I see you're lookin'
Looking for a sign
Praying for a beacon
So here's the light

[Pre-Chorus]
My arms will be wide open
For the moment you arrive, arrive

[Chorus]
When you set sail on your journey
And happiness is far away
Love will guide you 'til the mornin'
Lead your heart down to the bay
Don't resist the rain and storm
I'll never leave you lost at sea
I will be your lighthouse keeper
Bring you safely home to me
I will be your lighthouse keeper
Bring you safely home

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I see you're lonely
Going in alone
Fire up the engine
Stoke the coal
Floatin' on a feeling
Fighting with the tide
Hope you'll be home for Christmas time

[Pre-Chorus]
My arms will be wide open
For the moment you arrive, arrive

[Chorus]
When you set sail on your journey
And happiness is far away
Love will guide you 'til the morning
Lead your heart down to the bay
Don't resist the rain and storm
I'll never leave you lost at sea
I will be your lighthouse keeper
Bring you safely home to me
I will be your lighthouse keeper
Bring you safely home to me

[Intro]
Dum-dum-dum-dum

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
There's snow on the ground, love in the air, sleigh bells are ringin'
This is what it's all about, the fire is warm, the angels are singin'

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas with Joe Jonas]
And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put an end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always that time of the year

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas, never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist, right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
Look at the lights, twinklin' bright twenty-four/seven
Every inch of Central Park is covered in white, this could be heaven

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put an end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always that time of the year, yeah (Woo)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas), never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist, right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Bridge: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Woo, woo, woo, yeah (Everyday that I'm with you)
Everyday, every night (Oh, oh, all day)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas, never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist, right up at the top (And I can't deny)
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Outro: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Hey, hey, yeah, everyday, la-la-la
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
No matter the reason, no matter the season
My heart'll keep beatin', you better believe
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you

[Intro]
Oh, Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gon' come and make him mine, mine (Oh, Santa)
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas (Oh, Santa)
Santa's gon' come and make him mine, mine (Oh, oh)

[Verse 1]
Santa
If you get this letter, won't you help me out?
I know you're kinda busy with your elves right now
And I don't know how
You do the things you do while I'm 'sleep on Christmas Eve
But it's amazing
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby
Because every time I see Christmas lights
I feel this void inside and I just can't take it

[Pre-Chorus]
I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night

[Chorus]
Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gon' come and make him mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas night

[Verse 2]
Oh, Santa
I heard that it's really gonna snow this year
So I hope Rudolph and them other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up and swoop him right down my chimney
I've been really, really, really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
'Cause Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, ol' Kris Kringle, save me

[Pre-Chorus]
They say it's unrealistic
But I believe in you, Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick
Santa, won't you come and make him mine this Christmas night?

[Chorus]
Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gon' come and make him mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas night

[Bridge]
Oh, Santa
Oh, Santa (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh, Santa
Come on, Santa (Oh, Santa)
Santa gon' come and make him mine this Christmas (Oh, Santa)
Santa gon' come and make him mine, mine
Santa gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa gon' come and make him mine, mine (Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 3]
Oh, Santa Claus
If you get this letter, please don't make me wait
'Cause all December, I'll be counting down the days
So hop on your sleigh
I promise that I won't forget the milk and cookies

[Pre-Chorus]
The tree's all sparkly and gold
But inside, I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole
Santa, won't you come and make him mine this Christmas?

[Chorus]
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho (Oh)
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, mine (Santa)
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho (Hey)
Santa's gon' come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, mine
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make you mine this Christmas (Mine)
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho (This Christmas)
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, mine
Santa gon' come and make you mine this Christmas

[Verse 1]
Everybody's in a hurry, in a flurry
Shopping 'til they're droppin' in the snow
Kids are cryin', dogs are barkin'
Catchin' up with folks we barely know
Sure, it's madness, but it's magic
As soon as you hang up the mistletoe
'Cause you're the reason for the season
No, we don't need to keep up with the Jones

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love is something priceless

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

[Verse 2]
So, Mr. Santa (Mr. Santa)
Take the day off (Take the day off)
Get a massage (Get a massage)
'Cause we've got this one all under control
A little whiskey (A little whiskey)
We're getting frisky (Ooh!)
And slow dancing to Nat King Cole
No, we ain't stressin' (We ain't stressin')
Just caressin' (Mm-hmm)
Warming up our popsicle toes
Nothing's missin' (Nothing's missin')
'Cause you're a blessin' ('Cause you're the blessin')
Yeah, you're the only one I'm wishing for

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love is something priceless

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

[Bridge]
I don't need anything
Take back all the Cartier, and the Tiffany's and the Chanel
Well, can I keep that Chanel? Please?
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

[Outro]
(Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
Just you and me, under a tree
(Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
A cozy little Christmas here with you

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
I need you, Christmas
Friends by the fire to hold
Times have been lonely
And lately, I just feel alone
I need you, Christmas
Family with nowhere to go
Angels on treetops and angels in the snow
Oh, the cold

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Seasons change, come and go
But there's one thing I know
You'll just stay the same
You don't ever change

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I miss the feeling
Waiting for Santa to show
Caroling late night
And all the children's eyes aglow
I need you, Christmas
Oh, how I miss you the most
Greetings from loved ones
And lovers under mistletoe
Oh, oh, oh
If you're young, if you're old
We all wait to be told
Just a simple phrase
"Have a Merry Christmas"
Ooh, ooh
Christmas, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Seasons change, come and go
But there's one thing I hope
You'll just stay the same
'Cause I need you, Christmas

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Santa baby, slip a Sable under the tree for me (mmhmm)
I've been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 2: Liz Gillies]
Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus: Ariana Grande + Liz Gillies]
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed *kiss*
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande + Liz Gillies]
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lie
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 4: Ariana Grande]
Santa honey, the one little thing I really need
The deed to a platinum mine
Santa honey, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Chorus: Liz Gillies + Ariana Grande]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

[Bridge: Ariana Grande + Liz Gillies]
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
And I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
So hurry down the chimney tonight

[Outro: Ariana Grande + Liz Gillies]
Waiting
Hurry, tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 1]
Lights on the trees under falling snow
You get a bit closer when winter's cold
Now I can't wait till you're by my side
All of the best gifts, you just can't buy

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, you light up the room
I hope that you'll make it back home soon
'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you

[Verse 2]
I wish we were kissing under mistletoe
The stars on the sky just can't match your glow
Now I can't wait till you're by my side
We'll be warm by the fire all night, oh

[Verse 3]
I wanna hold you while the bells are all ringing
Want you to be here while the angel's singing
Days are perfect when I got you near
My only wish is you here

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, you light up the room
I hope that you'll make it back home soon
'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you
Wherever you are, you brighten the moon
I hope that you'll make it back home soon
'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you (Without you)

[Bridge]
We could be outside dancing under moonlight
Watching the sky roll over our heads
We could be inside trying to sing the lines right
Laughing until we fall out of bed
So when I wake up on Christmas Day
I hope the first thing I see is your face

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, you light up the room
I hope that you'll make it back home soon
'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you
Wherever you are, you brighten the moon
I hope that you'll make it back home soon
'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you (Without you)

[Outro]
It won't feel like Christmas without you

[Intro: Liam Payne]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah

[Verse 1: Liam Payne]
Turned on the lights
Party was over so I said my goodbyes
Stepped out the club and you were waiting outside
Gave you my coat 'cause I could see that you were cold

[Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne]
The driver messaged, said he's stuck in the snow
I said, "There's no way I'm not walking you home"
Next thing you know it, we were drying our clothes
But I didn't mean to get you in trouble (Oh)

[Chorus: Liam Payne with Dixie D'Amelio]
Now we're on the naughty list
Must've been the way we kissed
Santa saw the things we did
And put us on the naughty list (Oh)
Underneath the mistletoe (Mistletoe)
We were supposed to take it slow
Baby, you're my favourite gift
Now we're on the naughty list (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Dixie D'Amelio]
Under the tree
It's Christmas morning and there's nothing to see
One hundred messages like "Where have you been?"
No, I don't wanna but it's time for me to go (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Dixie D'Amelio]
My driver messaged that he's stuck in the snow (In the snow)
He said there is no way that I'm letting you go (Oh)
Next thing you know it, we were drying our clothes (Oh)
And I know you meant to get me in trouble

[Chorus: Liam Payne & Dixie D'Amelio, Dixie D'Amelio]
Now we're on the naughty list
Must've been the way we kissed
Santa saw the things we did
And put us on the naughty list (Naughty list, yeah)
Underneath the mistletoe
We were supposed to take it slow
Baby, you're my favourite gift
Now we're on the naughty list

[Bridge: Liam Payne]
Three-six-five days (Oh, yeah)
You round my place (Oh, yeah)
We'll misbehave
With kisses like snowflakes all over your body (All over your body)
Three-six-five days (Oh)
You round my place (You round my)
We'll misbehave
With kisses like snowflakes all over your body

[Chorus: Liam Payne & Dixie D'Amelio, Liam Payne]
Now we're on the naughty list
Must've been the way we kissed
Santa saw the things we did
And put us on the naughty list
Underneath the mistletoe (The mistletoe)
We were supposed to take it slow
Baby, you're my favourite gift
Now we're on the naughty list

[Verse 1: Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé]
I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go away
Baby, it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
But maybe just half a soda pop more
Put some records on while I pour

[Verse 2: Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé]
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, was that a wink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to get home for dinner
Mind if I move in closer?
So it's time for me to cast you aside
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby, don't hold out
Baby it's cold outside

[Interlude: Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé]
You're very pushy, you know
I'd like to think of it as opportunistic

[Verse 3: Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé]
I simply must go
Baby, it's cold outside
So thanks for the show
But, baby, it's cold outside
The welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh, your lips are delicious
But maybe just another dance more
Never such a blizzard before

[Verse 4: Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé]
I've got to get home
Baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your comb?
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when I touch your hand
But don't you see?
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life-long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you got pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that hold out
Baby it's cold
Baby it's cold outside

[Spoken Outro: Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé]
Okay, fine, just another drink
That took a lot of convincing

[Verse 1]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said, "Winter love is spreading everywhere"
Summer came and took off with the Spring
So now we start the Christmas caroling
I'll find my way back home
And light up every tree
We will hang our stockings for you and one for me
'Cause Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said, "Pack your bags and tell them you'll be there"

[Chorus]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home
Home, I'll be home
(I'll be home)

[Verse 2]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said, "Wrap the gifts with all your love and care"
The wind, it blows the snow up in the sky
But I won't let the wind delay my flight

[Chorus]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home
I'll be home, I'll be home
I promise, I promise
I'll be home, I'll be home
(I'll be home)

[Bridge]
Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said, "Pack your bags and tell him you'll be there"

[Chorus]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas (I'll be home)
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love this Christmas (I'll be home)
I promise, I promise I'll be home
I'll be home, I'll be home, oh

[Outro]
I'll be home with my love this Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home

[Verse 1]
Do you remember me?
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you
With childhood fantasies
Well, I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child
But my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown-up Christmas list
Not for myself
But for a world in need

[Chorus]
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown-up Christmas list

[Verse 2]
As children we believed
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely
Wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal
A hurting human soul

[Chorus]
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown-up Christmas list

[Bridge]
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth?
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth

[Chorus]
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown-up Christmas list

[Outro]
This is my only life I wish
This is my grown-up Christmas list

[Verse 1]
Baby, when December comes
When it's gettin' cold outside
And your bags are backed
I don't wanna say goodbye
When I see the trees light up
When they hang the mistletoe
And I'm by the fire, I don't wanna be alone

[Chorus]
Baby, won't you take me home for Christmas
Show me 'round your town
Take me where you used to watch the snow come down
Honor your traditions, I wanna know 'em all
You'll check every box off of my list
If you take me home for Christmas

[Post-Chorus]
Take me home, yeah
Take me home
Take me home

[Verse 2]
I wanna spend the night before
Drinkin' with your high school friends
'Round the neighborhood
We could do a little caroling
Watchin' Santa fly 'cross a Christmas moon
Don't need gifts this year if I got you

[Chorus]
Baby, won't you take me home for Christmas
Show me 'round your town
Take me where you used to watch the snow come down
Honor your traditions, I wanna know 'em all
You'll check every box off of my list
If you take me home for Christmas

[Bridge]
Wanna be by your side
When you open your eyes and say, "Baby, it's Christmas"
Yes, I do

[Chorus]
Baby, won't you take me home for Christmas
Show me 'round your town
Take me where you used to watch the snow come down (Snow come down)
Honor your traditions (La-da-da-da-da)
I wanna know 'em all ([?])
You'll check every box off of my list
If you take me home for Christmas (Home for Christmas)

[Post-Chorus]
Take me home (Oh, yeah, babe)
Take me home (Take me home)
Take me home (Hey!)

[Outro]
Dum-dum, dum-dum, dum-dum, dum-dum, da-dum-da
Da-dum
Oh, oh, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-yeah
Yeah, you know it, baby
Ooh
Oh, won't you take me home for Christmas?

Bah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1: Tori Kelly]
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Verse 2: Babyface]
You know it doesn't show signs of stoppin'
I bought some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Refrain: Tori Kelly & Babyface]
When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

[Verse 3: Tori Kelly, Both]
The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Break: Babyface & Tori Kelly]
Woo!
C'mon!
Da-duh, da-duh, da-duh
Hey!

[Refrain: Babyface & Tori Kelly]
When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

[Verse 4: Babyface & Tori Kelly]
You know the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow (Let it snow)
Let it snow (Let it snow)
Let it snow

[Outro: Tori Kelly]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Matt]
Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

[Verse 2: Scott]
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

[Chorus: Scott]
My chains are gone
I've been set free
My God, my Savior has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing grace

[Verse 3: Mitch]
The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

[Chorus: Mitch]
My chains are gone
I've been set free
My God, my Savior has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing grace

[Verse 4: Kirstin]
The Earth shall soon dissolve like snow
The sun forbear to shine
But God, Who called me here below
Will be forever mine

[Chorus: Kirstin]
My chains are gone
I've been set free
My God, my Savior has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing grace

[Outro: Kevin]
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

[Verse 1]
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

[Chorus]
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

[Verse 2]
A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot

[Chorus]
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

[Verse 3]
A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lie
But quickly drove away

[Chorus]
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

[Verse 4]
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song
Just get a bobtailed bay
Two forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack, you'll take the lead

[Chorus]
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
